# GreatSchoolsProject

The objective of the analysis is to find possible schools for our daughter. We've determined potential relocation areas (since we are renting at the time) and scraped data from greatschools.org which is a website that contains information about school ratings, test scores, and school size, among others.

First, we will explore, clean, and format the data. We'll try to discover patterns or relationships between the features of the schools. 

After that, we will focus on finding the best schools based on the criteria we determined to be relevant for our case.

The file GreatSchoolsScraper.ipynb is the scraper used to collect the data from greatschools.org, which has been saved in csv files located in the folder 'data'.
